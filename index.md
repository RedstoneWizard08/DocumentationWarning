# Welcome to DocumentationWarning!

DocumentationWarning is a project to automatically generate documentation
for Content Warning. The documentation is based on ***stripped*** assemblies,
meaning that none of the game's actual code was used to generate this.

## Notes

I had to write a script to add the namespace `DefaultNamespace` to every
class. This is not how it is in-game or in the assemblies. Just be wary of that.
