# @{{Game}} API Documentation

This is a project to automatically generate documentation for @{{Game}}.
<if [IsStripped]>The documentation is based on ***stripped*** assemblies, meaning that
none of the game's actual code was used to generate this.</if>
<if [IsNotStripped]>The documentation is based on the game's assemblies, however
they are not shared as part of the process in any way.</if>

## Notes

I had to write a script to add the namespace `@{{Namespace}}` to every
class. This is not how it is in-game or in the assemblies. Just be wary of that.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> If you haven't already, go buy the game! [Steam Page](@{{SteamPage}})

> For the game's devs, if you want me to take this site down, I will,
