    "keywords": "Subnautica: Below Zero API Documentation This is a project to automatically generate documentation for Subnautica: Below Zero. The documentation is based on stripped assemblies, meaning that none of the game's actual code was used to generate this. Notes I had to write a script to add the namespace DefaultNamespace to every class. This is not how it is in-game or in the assemblies. Just be wary of that. Important This documentation is NOT affiliated in ANY way with Unknown Worlds Entertainment, Subnautica: Below Zero, or any of its developers. In addition, this may not always be completely up-to-date with the latest version of the game, so use at your own risk. Note If you haven't already, go buy the game! Steam Page Note For the game's devs, if you want me to take this site down, I will, upon request. Just shoot me a DM, I'm on Discord as @RedstoneWizard08. I'll usually reply within a day or two. This project is NOT intended to cause any harm or anything like that."
